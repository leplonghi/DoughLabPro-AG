    intro: "Vegetables like zucchini, eggplant, and mushrooms are >90% water. When heated, their cell walls break down, releasing this water. If this happens on top of a pizza, the water pools in the center. Since the dough temperature cannot exceed 100°C while water is present, the crust under the vegetables never bakes—it boils. The result is a raw, gummy 'gum line'.",

    history: "Historical context coming soon.",

    technicalFoundations: [
        "Technique 1: Pre-Cooking (Roasting/Sautéing). The most reliable method. Cook the vegetables fully BEFORE putting them on the pizza. This drives off the water and develops flavor (Maillard reaction).",
        "Technique 2: Osmotic Draining (Salting). Slice the vegetables (zucchini/eggplant), toss them with salt, and let them sit in a colander for 30 minutes. The salt draws out moisture via osmosis. Pat dry before baking.",
        "Technique 3: Thin Slicing (Carpaccio). Slice extremely thin (mandoline). The high surface-area-to-volume ratio allows the water to evaporate instantly in the oven heat before it can soak into the dough."

    proTips: [
        "Mushrooms are Sponges. Never wash mushrooms with water; they absorb it. Brush them clean. For pizza, sauté them with oil and herbs until they release their liquid and re-absorb the fat. This concentrates the 'meaty' umami flavor."

    criticalPoints: [
        "Spinach Danger. Fresh spinach collapses and releases a lot of green water. Always wilt spinach in a pan and squeeze it dry (like a towel) before adding to pizza, or use it raw AFTER baking."
