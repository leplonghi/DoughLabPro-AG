    intro: "Balling is not just about making it round. It is about creating a 'skin' of tension on the outer surface of the dough. This tight skin acts as a containment vessel, forcing expansion upwards and pressurizing internal gas bubbles for explosive oven spring.",

    history: "In Naples, the process of dividing and shaping dough balls is known as 'Staglio a mano'. Traditionally done entirely by hand, the pizzaiolo pinches off a piece of dough ('mozzeratura') and rolls it on the marble bench. This manual technique remains the gold standard for artisan pizza, ensuring delicate gluten structure is preserved.",

    practicalApplications: [
        "Practice the 'mozzeratura' or hand-rolling technique for artisan results.",
        "Ensure the seam is completely sealed at the bottom of the ball.",
        "Allow balls to rest (relax) before stretching; you cannot stretch immediately after balling."
    ],

    proTips: [
        "The 'Rest' Period: You cannot stretch a dough ball immediately after balling. The gluten is too tight (elastic). It needs to relax (typically 2-6 hours at room temp, or 24h cold) before it becomes extensible enough to open."
    ],

    criticalPoints: [
        "Tearing the Skin: If you ball too aggressively, you will tear the outer surface (rough, 'shredded' texture). This destroys gas retention. The skin must be smooth and taut."
