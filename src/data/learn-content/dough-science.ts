    intro: "DoughLabPro is built on this scientific foundation. We treat dough as a complex biochemical system where every variable—temperature, hydration, time—can be measured and controlled to produce the perfect outcome every time.",

    history: "For centuries, baking was considered more of an art or even magic than a science. Recipes were passed down orally, and success depended on 'feeling' the dough. The scientific understanding of gluten, enzymes, and yeast metabolism is a relatively recent development, pioneered in the 19th and 20th centuries.",

    technicalFoundations: [
        "The Four Pillars: Flour (Structure/Fuel), Water (Solvent), Yeast (Engine), Salt (Regulator).",
        "Viscoelasticity: Dough is both viscous (flows) and elastic (bounces back).",
        "P/L Ratio: The balance between tenacity (P) and extensibility (L).",
        "The Role of Time: Time allows enzymes to break down starches and proteins for flavor."
    ],

    doughImpact: [
        "Viscosity allows expansion.",
        "Elasticity allows gas retention.",
        "Long fermentation changes chemical composition (more sugars, amino acids)."
    ],

    bakingImpact: [
        "Proper P/L ratio ensures good oven spring.",
        "Enzymatic activity leads to better browning (Maillard reaction)."

    practicalApplications: [
        "Treat temperature with the same precision as flour weight.",
        "Use strong flour (W300+) for high-hydration, long-fermentation doughs.",
        "Balance hydration, mixing, and fermentation to achieve the right P/L ratio."
    ],

    proTips: [
        "Temperature is an Ingredient. A 2°C difference in final dough temperature can change the fermentation rate by 15-20%."
    ],

    criticalPoints: [
        "The 'W' Factor. Not all flour is created equal. You cannot make a high-hydration, long-fermentation dough with 'All Purpose' flour (W180)."
