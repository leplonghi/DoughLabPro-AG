  "intro": "Represents the 'New Wave' of Italian pizza. It focuses on extreme digestibility, visual impact (Instagrammable structure), and gourmet toppings. It challenges the strict AVPN rules while respecting the roots.",
  "history": "A modern evolution often called 'Pizza Canotto' (dinghy) due to its large, airy rim. Pioneers like Carlo Sammarco and Franco Pepe pushed hydration limits to create a lighter, more alveolated structure than the traditional style, often using preferments (Biga/Poolish) or autolyse. It represents the 'New Wave' or 'Contemporary' movement that started around 2010 in Caserta and Naples.",
  "culturalContext": {
    "significance": [
      "The 'Haute Couture' of modern pizza, often referred to as 'Pizza Gourmet'",

  "doughImpact": [
    "High hydration (65-75%) and preferments (Biga/Poolish) create a complex, honeycombed interior",
    "High-protein flour (W 300-350) is mandatory to support the extreme vertical expansion",

  "bakingImpact": [
    "Very high heat (400-450°C) provides the 'thermal expansion' needed for the canotto rise",
    "Short bake time (60-90 seconds) keeps the interior moisture high while charring the skin",
    "Flash-baking (vampata) creates the 'leopard spotting' on the highly aerated edges",
    "Steam release from the high-hydration dough helps slightly inflate the cornicione in the oven",
    "Lower floor temp than Classic Neapolitan helps prevent the bottom from burning before the rim rises"

    "Neo-Neapolitan - A broader term for the style when made outside of Italy"
  ],
  "climateScenarios": [
    "Very Hot/Humid: Use 100% cold preferment; reduce hydration by 2-3% to combat 'sweating' dough",
    "Dry/Cold: Use warm water (30°C) for Poolish; cover balls with oil film and plastic during room-temp proof",
    "Coastal Moisture: May require 0.5% more salt (to 3%) to strengthen the gluten for the massive stretch",
    "High Altitude: Reduce yeast by 30% to prevent the puffy rim from collapsing after exiting the oven"
  ],
  "styleComparisons": [
    "vs. Classic AVPN: Contemporary is higher hydration, uses preferments, and has a vastly larger rim",
    "vs. NY Style: Contemporary has almost no oil/sugar and is much softer and lighter",
    "vs. Roman Pala: Both are high hydration, but Contemporary is wood-fired and 'flash-baked'",
    "vs. Artisan American: Very similar, but Contemporary strictly adheres to Italian flour standards"
  ],
  "parameterSensitivity": [
    "Critical: Flour W (Strength) - using standard flour will result in a flat, dense pizza",
    "Highly sensitive: Finished dough temp (21-23°C) - too warm and the bubbles merge into a 'void'",
    "Preferment Acidity: If Biga gets too sour, the gluten will weaken, losing the Canotto spring",
    "Folding Technique: Must be handled with 'silk gloves' during shaping to keep air in the Corincione",
    "Oven Recovery Time: Must have a stone that recovers temp quickly for the next flash-bake"
  ],
  "risks": [
    "The 'Big Void': Too much air forming one massive hole instead of a honeycomb (over-proofed)",
    "Gummy Texture: Caused by under-baking or using flour with too low enzyme activity",
    "Collapsing Rim: Dough too weak to support its own structure after removal from the oven",
    "Center Sog: High hydration dough requires very controlled, fast topping application",
    "Leopard Spots without Bake: 'Fake' spots caused by cold dough hitting a hot stone too soon"
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Use a Type 0 flour with high protein (13-14%) specifically designed for high hydration",
    "Biga 100% (Giorilli method) is the secret to the most spectacular Contemporary structures",
    "Stretch from the center out to push all the air into the rim - never touch the cornicione with your fingers",
    "Scissors are essential for serving this pizza to guests; it preserves the 'theatre' of the honeycomb",
    "Keep the tomato sauce cold to create a thermal barrier for the delicate thin center"

    {
      "question": "What is 'Pizza Canotto'?",
      "answer": "It is a modern variant of Neapolitan pizza characterized by an extremely high, light, and airy rim (cornicione). The name 'Canotto' means 'inflatable dinghy' in Italian, referring to the large volume of the crust."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why use Biga or Poolish in this style?",
      "answer": "Preferments help create a stronger and more elastic gluten network, necessary to support the exaggerated vertical expansion during baking. They also provide a more aromatic, flavorful, and digestible cornicione."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main technical difference from Classic Neapolitan?",
      "answer": "Contemporary Neapolitan uses higher hydration (65-75% vs 58-62%), stronger flours (W300+ vs W250), and long fermentation techniques with preferments, resulting in a much lighter and airier structure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I make Pizza Canotto in a home oven?",
      "answer": "It is difficult, as the expansion of the 'canotto' requires a 'thermal shock' of at least 400°C. In 250°C ovens, the dough tends to cook slowly and lose its lift, resulting in a heavier, more compact rim."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the pizza cut with scissors?",
      "answer": "Scissors prevent the pressure of a knife from flattening the delicate air bubbles inside the rim. Cutting with scissors 'preserves' the honeycomb structure (alveolatura) that is the pride of contemporary pizza makers."
