  "intro": "The quintessential American street food. Cheap, fast, and eaten on the go. The 'New York Fold' is a practical necessity to keep the molten cheese and oil from sliding off.",
  "history": "Descended from Neapolitan immigrants (Lombardi's, 1905), this style evolved to suit coal and later gas deck ovens. The dough became larger (18-20 inches), lower moisture, and tougher to handle the 'slice fold'. The use of bromated high-gluten flour became a standard for that specific chew.",
