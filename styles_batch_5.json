    "description": "Brioche is a highly enriched Viennoiserie pastry of French origin, whose high egg and butter content gives it a rich and tender crumb. The classic 'Brioche à Tête' or 'Nanterre' is characterized by a paper-thin, golden-brown crust and a soft, shreddable interior that relies on strong gluten development to support the heavy fat load.",
    "history": "The word 'brioche' first appeared in 1404. It evolved from a blessed bread used in church services to a luxury item. The modern high-butter version became possible with the improvement of yeast and flour quality in the 19th century. Normany, famous for its butter, is often cited as the spiritual home of the highest quality brioche. It sits on the line between bread and pastry (Viennoiserie).",

It typically includes small amounts of sugar and fat (shortening) and is baked with steam to produce a 'craquelé' crust.",
    "history": "Influenced by French baking travelers in the early 20th century, Brazilian bakers adapted the recipe to local flours (which were softer) and tastes. They added sugar and fat to ensure consistent fermentation and texture. It became the 'Pão de Sal' consumed daily by millions. The Brazilian technical standard (ABNT NBR 16170) now defines its characteristics.",
