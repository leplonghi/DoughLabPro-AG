    "chicago_deep_dish_history": "Chicago deep dish pizza was invented in 1943 at Pizzeria Uno. While founder Ike Sewell is often credited, pizza historian Peter Regas suggests Ric Riccardo, Sewell's business partner, was the mastermind. Other key figures include Adolpho 'Rudy' Malnati Sr., credited in a 1956 Chicago Daily News article with creating the original recipe, and Alice May Redmond, the restaurant's cook who adjusted it. The style emerged during the 1940s as an attempt to create a more substantial, meal-worthy pizza compared to traditional thin-crust snacks. Lou Malnati, Rudy's son, later opened Lou Malnati's Pizzeria in 1971, becoming renowned for its buttery crust and fresh, uncooked tomatoes.",

    "chicago_deep_dish_faq_1_q": "Why is the sauce on top of Chicago deep dish pizza?",
    "chicago_deep_dish_faq_1_a": "The sauce is placed on top for a practical reason: insulation. During the long 30-40 minute bake time required to cook through the thick layers, exposed cheese and meat would burn. The chunky tomato sauce on top protects them from direct heat while adding moisture and flavor. This reverse layering is essential to deep dish construction.",
    "chicago_deep_dish_faq_2_q": "Is Chicago deep dish really pizza or is it a casserole?",
    "chicago_deep_dish_faq_2_a": "While some pizza purists debate this, deep dish is technically a pizza - it has dough, sauce, cheese, and toppings. However, it's more accurately described as a 'pizza pie' or 'pizza casserole' due to its thick, substantial nature and requirement for utensils. It's a unique Chicago creation that bridges pizza and casserole.",
    "chicago_deep_dish_faq_3_q": "Do Chicagoans actually eat deep dish pizza regularly?",
    "chicago_deep_dish_faq_3_a": "Not typically. While deep dish is Chicago's most famous pizza style internationally, many locals prefer 'tavern-style' thin crust pizza for regular consumption. Deep dish is often reserved for special occasions, entertaining out-of-town guests, or when craving something particularly hearty and indulgent."
