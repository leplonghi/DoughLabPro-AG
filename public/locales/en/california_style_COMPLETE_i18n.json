    "california_style_history": "California-style pizza was born from the innovative spirit of California Cuisine in the early 1980s. Chef Ed LaDou, working at Prego Restaurant, began experimenting with unique toppings like ricotta, red peppers, pâté, and mustard. Wolfgang Puck was so impressed that he hired LaDou to lead Spago's pizza program when it opened in 1982. Together, they developed over 250 pizza concepts, moving beyond traditional pepperoni to embrace sophisticated flavors. Alice Waters at Chez Panisse also pioneered wood-fired pizzas with unusual, locally sourced toppings like leeks and duck confit starting in 1980. Spago became famous for Puck's signature smoked salmon pizza with dill crème fraîche, smoked salmon, caviar, and caramelized shallots. The style emphasized open kitchens centered around wood-burning ovens, fresh California ingredients, and creative freedom.",

    "california_style_faq_1_a": "California-style pizza is defined by its creative, gourmet toppings featuring fresh, seasonal, local ingredients. Pioneered by Wolfgang Puck and Alice Waters in the 1980s, it moved beyond traditional pizza toppings to include ingredients like smoked salmon, duck confit, goat cheese, and seasonal vegetables. The thin, crispy crust from wood-fired ovens serves as a canvas for culinary creativity.",
    "california_style_faq_2_q": "Who invented California-style pizza?",
    "california_style_faq_2_a": "California-style pizza was pioneered by two key figures: Alice Waters at Chez Panisse (starting in 1980) and Wolfgang Puck at Spago (opened 1982). Chef Ed LaDou, working with Puck, was instrumental in developing over 250 pizza concepts. Puck's smoked salmon pizza with dill crème fraîche and caviar became the iconic signature of the style.",
    "california_style_faq_3_q": "Can I make California-style pizza at home?",
    "california_style_faq_3_a": "Yes! The key is using the freshest, highest-quality seasonal ingredients and a very hot oven (500-550°F home oven max, or use a pizza stone/steel). Focus on creative, balanced toppings - don't overload the pizza. A pizza stone or steel preheated for 45-60 minutes helps achieve the crispy crust. The spirit of California-style is creativity and fresh ingredients, not specific equipment.",
    "california_style_faq_4_q": "What are some classic California-style pizza toppings?",
    "california_style_faq_4_a": "Classic combinations include: smoked salmon with dill crème fraîche and caviar (Spago's signature), duck confit with leeks, goat cheese with sun-dried tomatoes and arugula, grilled chicken with BBQ sauce, Thai chicken with peanut sauce, and seasonal vegetables like zucchini flowers. The key is using high-quality, fresh ingredients in unexpected but harmonious combinations.",
    "california_style_faq_5_q": "Is California-style pizza expensive?",
    "california_style_faq_5_a": "California-style pizza tends to be more expensive than traditional styles due to premium, seasonal ingredients and upscale restaurant settings. Individual pizzas at restaurants like Spago can cost $20-40+. However, the style has been adapted by chains like California Pizza Kitchen to be more affordable while maintaining the creative spirit. At home, costs vary based on ingredient choices."
