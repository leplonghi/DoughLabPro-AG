    "baguette_tradition_francaise_history": "While the exact origins of the baguette are debated, theories connect it to 19th-century Vienna, the French Revolution, or early 20th-century Paris. Before the baguette, French bread was typically round and dense. The elongated shape allowed faster baking, particularly relevant after a 1920 law limited bakers' working hours. The term 'baguette' was officially adopted in 1920. Steam ovens invented in the late 19th century enabled the characteristic crispy crust. By the 1930s, the baguette had become ubiquitous and an icon of French culture. The crucial 'Le Décret Pain' (Bread Decree) of September 13, 1993 (decree no. 93-1074) legally protected the 'baguette de tradition française,' mandating it contain only wheat flour, water, salt, and yeast/leaven, with no frozen dough, additives, or preservatives. This law distinguishes true artisan boulangeries from industrial bakeries. UNESCO inscribed 'the artisanal know-how and culture of baguette bread' on its Intangible Cultural Heritage list on November 30, 2022.",

It must contain only four ingredients (wheat flour, water, salt, yeast/leaven) with no frozen dough, additives, or preservatives. It must be kneaded, shaped, and baked on-site at the boulangerie. Regular baguettes can use additives, frozen dough, and industrial production methods.",

    "baguette_tradition_francaise_faq_2_a": "UNESCO inscribed 'the artisanal know-how and culture of baguette bread' on its Intangible Cultural Heritage list in November 2022. This recognizes the baguette's cultural importance to French identity, the traditional craftsmanship of artisan bakers, and the daily ritual of buying fresh bread. It aims to safeguard these practices and support artisan boulangeries.",
    "baguette_tradition_francaise_faq_3_q": "How long does a fresh baguette stay good?",
    "baguette_tradition_francaise_faq_3_a": "A fresh baguette is at peak quality for 4-6 hours after baking. The crispy crust begins softening after a few hours. This is why French people buy bread daily. Day-old baguette is perfect for toast or pain perdu (French toast). Never refrigerate - it accelerates staling. Store at room temperature in a paper bag or bread box."
