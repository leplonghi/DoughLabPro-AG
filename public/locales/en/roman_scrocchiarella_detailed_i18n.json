    "roman_scrocchiarella_history": "While flatbreads have existed in Rome since ancient times, modern Roman-style pizza emerged in the post-World War II period, gaining prominence in the 1950s. It developed in neighborhood bakeries as a convenient, on-the-go snack for busy Romans. Unlike the softer, puffier Neapolitan style, Roman pizza evolved with a distinctly crispy texture achieved through oil in the dough, thin rolling, and high-heat baking. The scrocchiarella represents the pinnacle of Roman pizza's crispy tradition, often baked in wood-fired ovens to achieve maximum crunch while maintaining an airy interior.",

    "roman_scrocchiarella_faq_1_a": "Scrocchiarella is an onomatopoeic word in Romanesco dialect meaning 'crispy' or 'crunchy.'

    "roman_scrocchiarella_faq_2_q": "How is Roman pizza different from Neapolitan pizza?",
    "roman_scrocchiarella_faq_2_a": "Roman pizza is the opposite of Neapolitan in texture. While Neapolitan has a soft, chewy crust with a thick, puffy edge (cornicione), Roman scrocchiarella is ultra-thin, crispy throughout, and cracker-like. Roman pizza uses oil in the dough and is rolled with a rolling pin, while Neapolitan uses no oil and is hand-stretched. Roman pizza is also baked at lower temperatures for longer.",
    "roman_scrocchiarella_faq_3_q": "Why is Roman pizza so crispy?",
    "roman_scrocchiarella_faq_3_a": "Several factors create the signature crispness: oil in the dough (often seed oil rather than olive oil), rolling the dough extremely thin with a rolling pin, high-heat baking, and long fermentation that creates an airy structure. The combination of these techniques results in a pizza that's crispy like a cracker while remaining light and airy inside."
