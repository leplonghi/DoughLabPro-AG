Invented in 1946 at Buddy's Rendezvous using repurposed automotive industry steel pans, it embodies Detroit's industrial heritage and culinary innovation.",
    "detroit_style_history": "Detroit-style pizza originated in 1946 at Buddy's Rendezvous, a neighborhood bar owned by Gus Guerra on Detroit's east side. Guerra, with help from his wife Anna or employee Connie Piccinato, developed the pizza drawing inspiration from Sicilian-style pizza. Legend has it that Guerra acquired the distinctive blue steel pans from a friend who worked in an automotive factory, where they were originally used to hold small parts or as drip pans. These heavy, thick steel pans became crucial to the style, conducting heat evenly and creating a soft, airy crust with a crunchy exterior. The pizza gained wider recognition nationally after the 2008 financial crisis, as Detroit natives moved across the country seeking to recreate the beloved taste of home.",

These pans were originally used to hold small parts or as drip pans. The heavy, thick steel conducts heat evenly and creates the signature crispy bottom and caramelized cheese edges. This repurposing symbolizes Detroit's industrial resourcefulness.",
    "detroit_style_faq_3_q": "What is 'frico' and why is it important to Detroit-style pizza?",
    "detroit_style_faq_3_a": "Frico is the crispy, lacy, caramelized cheese crust that forms around the edges of Detroit-style pizza. It's created by spreading Wisconsin brick cheese all the way to the pan edges, where it melts and caramelizes against the hot steel during baking. This creates a crunchy, nutty, deeply flavorful cheese crust that's the most distinctive and beloved feature of Detroit-style pizza."
