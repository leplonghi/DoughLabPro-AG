    "styles.pita_bread_desc": "The iconic 'pocket bread' of the Middle East. It puffs up dramatically in a hot oven due to rapid steam expansion, creating a hollow center perfect for stuffing.",
    "styles.pita_bread_history": "One of the oldest breads in human history, dating back to the Natufian culture in Jordan (14,000 years ago). The 'pocket' mechanism is a masterful use of thermodynamics discovered millennia ago.",
    "styles.pita_bread_science_flour": "Requires moderate strength. If too strong, it resists expansion (no pocket). If too weak, it pops. Extensibility is key for the steam to push the layers apart.",
    "styles.pita_bread_proc_science": "The Pocket mechanism: At 260°C+, water turns to steam instantly. The top crust sets slightly, but the internal pressure is so high (>100kPa) that it delaminates the dough structure in the weakest center plane, ballooning it.",

    "styles.simit_science_flour": "Requires strength to hold the twisted shape. Hydration is low (55%) to ensure the 'crisp' texture, not soft like a bun.",
