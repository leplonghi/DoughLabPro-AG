    "ciabatta_high_hydration_history": "Ciabatta is a remarkably recent invention in the world of bread. In 1982, Arnaldo Cavallari, a miller and baker in Adria, Veneto, developed ciabatta as a direct response to French baguettes threatening traditional Italian bread sales for sandwiches. He initially named it 'ciabatta polesana' after Polesine, his home region. The defining characteristic is its high hydration dough (70% or more water), which creates a light, airy texture with large, irregular holes. This high water content strengthens the gluten network, allowing more air to be trapped and contributing to its chewy texture and signature open crumb structure. By 1999, Cavallari's company, Molini Adriesi, had licensed the recipe to bakers in 11 countries. Ciabatta was introduced to the United Kingdom in 1985 and to the United States in 1987, quickly becoming a global favorite for sandwiches and artisan bread lovers.",

    "ciabatta_high_hydration_faq_1_a": "Ciabatta's signature large, irregular holes come from its very high hydration (70-80% water). This wet dough creates a strong gluten network that traps large air bubbles during fermentation. Gentle handling preserves these bubbles, and the high water content allows them to expand dramatically during baking, creating the characteristic open crumb structure.",

    "ciabatta_high_hydration_faq_3_a": "Ciabatta means 'slipper' in Italian, a reference to the bread's characteristic flat, elongated shape that resembles a slipper or house shoe. This descriptive name perfectly captures the bread's rustic, informal appearance - wide, flat, and slightly irregular, just like a well-worn slipper."
