    "pane_toscano_cultural_context": "Pane Toscano DOP is famous for being 'sciocco' (saltless). Its origin dates back to the 12th century when Pisa blocked salt shipments to Florence during their rivalry. Florentines simply started making bread without it. This absence of salt allows the bread to perfectly accompany the intensely salty and savory flavors of Tuscan cuisine, such as Prosciutto Crudo, Finocchiona, and Pecorino Toscano. It is also the foundation of 'Pappa al Pomodoro' and 'Ribollita'.",

    "pane_toscano_science_flour": "A relatively weak flour is traditional. Without salt to tighten the gluten network, a high-protein flour would become too chewy. The Type 0 flour maintains a rustic, open crumb that is highly absorbent, perfect for soaking up olive oil or soups.",

    "pane_toscano_exp_1": "The Salt Contrast: Bake two small loaves: one with 0% salt and one with 2% salt. Taste both with a piece of very salty Pecorino. Notice how the saltless bread highlights the cheese flavor.",
    "pane_toscano_exp_2": "Sourdough Maturity: Compare a Pane Toscano made with a young 'sweet' starter vs. an older 'acidic' starter to see how the lack of salt amplifies the sourdough's lactic notes."
