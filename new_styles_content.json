    "lefse_history_full": "Lefse (Potato Flatbread) is a traditional Norwegian soft flatbread made from riced potatoes, flour, butter, and cream. Originating as a way to stretch grain supplies after the introduction of potatoes to Norway in the 18th century, it became a beloved staple. While everyday versions existed, the rich, potato-heavy production became a festive specialty, widely associated with Christmas and family gatherings. It holds immense cultural significance in the Norwegian-American diaspora as a symbol of heritage.",
