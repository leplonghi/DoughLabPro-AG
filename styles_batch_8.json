    "description": "The 'Canotto' (dinghy) style is a contemporary evolution of Neapolitan pizza. Unlike the traditional STG/AVPN style, it features an exaggerated, puffy, and airy cornicione (rim) with a large alveolation. This is achieved through higher hydration (65-75%), the use of preferments (Biga/Poolish), and strong flours capable of long cold fermentation.",
    "history": "Emerging in the suburbs of Naples (like Caserta) in the early 2010s, a new generation of pizzaioli (e.g., Carlo Sammarco, Francesco Martucci) began pushing the boundaries of hydration and fermentation. They moved away from the 'wagon wheel' flatness of traditional Neapolitan pizza towards a structure resembling high-hydration artisan bread. While initially controversial among traditionalists, it has gained global popularity for its lightness and digestibility.",
