    "primaryFlavors": [
      "Delicate wheat flavor with subtle sweetness from high-quality flour",

      "Beverage: Roman white wine (Frascati), Prosecco, or craft lager",

  "technicalFoundations": [
    "Direct dough with long fermentation (24-48h cold)",
    "Hydration: 70-75%"
  ],
  
  "doughImpact": [
    "High hydration (70-75%) creates extensibility for ultra-thin stretching",
    "Long cold fermentation develops flavor and improves structure",
    "Minimal fat content keeps crust light and crispy, not rich",
    "Strong flour provides structure to support thin profile",
    "Dough must be stretched paper-thin - thicker spots become chewy"
  ],
  
  "bakingImpact": [
    "Very high temperature (300-350°C) creates instant crisping",
    "Short bake time (3-5 min) prevents burning while achieving crispiness",
    "Deck or stone baking provides intense bottom heat",
    "Minimal toppings prevent sogginess from moisture",
    "Result: uniformly crispy, cracker-like texture throughout"
  ],
  
  "regionalVariants": [
    "Scrocchiarella Classica - Original ultra-thin style",
    "Pizza Romana Tonda - Slightly thicker, still crispy",
    "Pizza al Taglio - Rectangular, sold by weight, less crispy",
    "Pinsa Romana - Oval shape, lighter dough, modern variation"
  ],
  
  "climateScenarios": [
    "Hot/Humid (>25°C, >70% RH): Reduce fermentation time by 20%, use cooler water",
    "Cold/Dry (<15°C, <40% RH): Extend fermentation time by 30%, use warmer water",
    "Tropical: Refrigerate dough throughout, reduce yeast by 15%",
    "High Altitude (>1500m): Increase hydration by 2-3%, reduce bake time"
  ],
  
  "styleComparisons": [
    "vs. Neapolitan: Roman is ultra-thin, crispy vs soft, wet, thick edges",
    "vs. New York: Roman is thinner, crispier, lighter vs chewy, foldable",
    "vs. Roman Teglia: Scrocchiarella is round, thinner vs rectangular, thicker",
    "vs. Pinsa: Scrocchiarella is traditional wheat vs pinsa uses rice/soy flour blend"
  ],
  
  "parameterSensitivity": [
    "Critical: Thickness - must be paper-thin, any thick spots become chewy",
    "Highly sensitive: Oven temperature - below 300°C won't achieve crispiness",
    "Topping amount critical: too much creates soggy spots",
    "Bake time precise: 30 seconds too long = burnt, too short = soft",
    "Dough temperature: must be room temp for easy stretching"
  ],
  
  "risks": [
    "Thick spots: Uneven stretching creates chewy areas instead of crispy",
    "Soggy center: Too much sauce or wet toppings",
    "Burnt edges: Oven too hot or bake time too long",
    "Tears during stretching: Dough too cold or under-fermented",
    "Loss of crispiness: Letting pizza sit too long before eating"
  ],
  
  "notes": [
    "The name 'scrocchiarella' literally means 'little crunchy one'",
    "Authentic Roman scrocchiarella should be so thin you can almost see through it",
    "Unlike Neapolitan, there's no puffy cornicione - uniformly thin throughout",
    "Best eaten immediately - doesn't travel well or hold",
    "The crunch is the defining characteristic - if it's not crispy, it's not scrocchiarella"
  ],
  
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How thin should scrocchiarella pizza be?",
      "answer": "Authentic scrocchiarella should be extremely thin - about 1-2mm thick, almost translucent in spots. You should be able to see light through the thinnest parts. The entire pizza should be uniformly thin with no thick edges or cornicione like Neapolitan pizza. If it's thicker than 3mm anywhere, it's not true scrocchiarella."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my Roman pizza turn out chewy instead of crispy?",
      "answer": "Chewy texture indicates: 1) Dough too thick - must be paper-thin throughout, 2) Oven temperature too low - need 300-350°C minimum, 3) Too many wet toppings creating steam, 4) Bake time too short - needs full 3-5 minutes, 5) Letting pizza sit too long before eating. The key is extreme thinness + very high heat + minimal toppings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I make scrocchiarella in a home oven?",
      "answer": "It's challenging but possible. Home ovens typically max out at 260-290°C, which is lower than ideal (300-350°C). Use a pizza steel or stone preheated for 1 hour at maximum temperature. Place pizza on lowest rack for maximum bottom heat. Bake time will be longer (5-7 min vs 3-5 min). The result won't be quite as crispy as professional ovens but can still be very good if dough is thin enough."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between scrocchiarella and pizza al taglio?",
      "answer": "Scrocchiarella is round, ultra-thin (1-2mm), and extremely crispy throughout - eaten immediately after baking. Pizza al taglio (pizza by the cut) is rectangular, thicker (5-10mm), and has a softer, breadier texture - designed to sit in display cases and be sold by weight. Scrocchiarella is a sit-down pizzeria style, while al taglio is street food/takeaway."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do toppings need to be minimal on scrocchiarella?",
      "answer": "The ultra-thin crust can't support heavy or wet toppings without becoming soggy. Excess moisture from sauce, fresh mozzarella, or vegetables will steam the crust during baking, preventing crispiness. Traditional scrocchiarella uses: thin layer of sauce, moderate cheese, and 1-2 light toppings maximum. The crust is the star - toppings should complement, not overwhelm."
