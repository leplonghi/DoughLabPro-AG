    "ciabatta_classic_cultural_context": "Ciabatta (meaning 'slipper') is a relatively modern invention, created in 1982 by Arnaldo Cavallari in Adria, Veneto. It was a patriotic response to the popularity of French baguettes, designed to use Italian flours to create a bread perfect for sandwiches (panini). Its signature flat shape and massive, irregular holes were revolutionary at a time when Italian bread was mostly dense. It is now a global symbol of rustic Italian baking.",

    "ciabatta_classic_science_flour_type": "Type 0 (High Strength)",
    "ciabatta_classic_science_flour": "The extreme hydration (often 80%+) requires a very high-strength flour with a stable protein quality. The flour must be able to withstand long fermentation and intensive mixing to build a gluten 'cage' strong enough to trap the massive gas bubbles characteristic of the style.",

    "ciabatta_classic_watchout_1": "Collapsing: If the dough is over-fermented or handled too roughly during shaping, the internal structure will collapse, resulting in a flat, dense 'pancake' rather than a slipper.",
    "ciabatta_classic_watchout_2": "Weak Flour: Do not use weak 'National' flour for Ciabatta. It will simply dissolve into a sticky puddle that cannot trap gas.",
    "ciabatta_classic_exp_1": "The Hydration Jump: Bake three batches at 70%, 80%, and 90% hydration using the same flour. Map the relationship between hydration and hole size (alveolation).",
    "ciabatta_classic_exp_2": "Biga vs. Poolish: Bake one ciabatta using a stiff biga (50% hydration) and one using a liquid poolish (100% hydration). Compare the aromatic profile and the 'chewiness' of the crumb."
