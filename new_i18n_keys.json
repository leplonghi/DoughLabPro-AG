    "styles.stollen_history": "Stollen (or Christstollen) is one of Germany's oldest festive traditions, with records dating back to 1474 in Dresden. Originally a simple, lean fasting bread for Advent (made only of flour, yeast, and water as the Catholic Church forbade butter and milk), it was transformed in 1491 when Pope Innocent VIII issued the 'Butterbrief' (Butter Letter), allowing the use of milk and butter in exchange for a contribution to the church. Over centuries, it evolved into a dense, rich loaf packed with rum-soaked fruits, nuts, and marzipan, shaped to represent the swaddled Christ Child—hence its traditional name, Christstollen.",

    "styles.stollen_faq_1_q": "Can I eat the Stollen as soon as it's baked?",
    "styles.stollen_faq_1_a": "You can, but it will taste like a heavy, unfinished bread. The true magic of Stollen happens during the 2-4 week ripening period. This time allows the moisture from the fruit to migrate into the crumb and the spices to mellow and blend. It's the difference between a good bread and a legendary Christmas treat.",
    "styles.stollen_faq_2_q": "How do I store a Stollen so it doesn't mold or dry out?",
    "styles.stollen_faq_2_a": "The secret is the 'Butter and Sugar Seal'. Brushing it with lots of butter and coating it in sugar creates a hermetic barrier. Wrap the cooled loaf tightly in parchment paper, then several layers of foil, and store in a cool, dark place (like a cellar or a pantry, but not the fridge).",
    "styles.stollen_faq_3_q": "Why is my Stollen so dense and crumbly?",
    "styles.stollen_faq_3_a": "Stollen should be dense! It's closer to a cake in texture than a sandwich bread. This is due to the very high fat and fruit content which inhibits long gluten strands. If it's *too* crumbly, you might have over-baked it or used a flour with too low protein.",
    "styles.stollen_faq_4_q": "What is the marzipan in the middle?",
    "styles.stollen_faq_4_a": "Marzipan is a sweet paste made from ground almonds and sugar. In a 'Marzipanstollen', a log of this paste is placed in the center during shaping. It adds a moist, creamy heart to the slice and complements the citrus and rum flavors beautifully.",
    "styles.stollen_faq_5_q": "How long does a properly made Stollen last?",
    "styles.stollen_faq_5_a": "A well-made, well-sealed Christstollen can last up to 3 months in a cool, dark place. The high sugar, alcohol-soaked fruit, and fat content act as natural preservatives. In fact, many people say it tastes best 6 weeks after baking.",

Seeking a way to use the same machinery and specialized Lievito Madre (natural yeast) during the spring months, advertising executive Dino Villani created the dove-shaped bread. Legend, however, dates it much earlier to the 6th-century siege of Pavia, where King Alboin was purportedly offered a dove-shaped bread as a peace offering.

    "styles.colomba_faq_3_q": "Is the almond glaze mandatory?",
    "styles.colomba_faq_3_a": "Yes, for the authentic Italian 'Colomba di Pasqua'. The glaze, made from egg whites, sugar, and ground almonds (and often cornstarch), provides the signature crackly texture and helps steam the interior dough during baking, keeping it extra moist.",
    "styles.colomba_faq_4_q": "How long does an artisanal Colomba stay fresh?",
    "styles.colomba_faq_4_a": "Due to the natural acidity of the Lievito Madre and the high fat/sugar content, a well-made Colomba can stay fresh for up to 30-45 days if kept in its original bag. We recommend warming a slice slightly if eating it more than 10 days after baking.",
    "styles.colomba_faq_5_q": "Why do I have to hang it upside down?",
    "styles.colomba_faq_5_a": "The structure is so delicate and airy (like a cloud) that while it is hot, the weight of the orange peel and the high fat content would cause it to collapse into a dense mass. Hanging it allows gravity to stretch the gluten network as it sets, preserving the honeycomb internal structure.",
