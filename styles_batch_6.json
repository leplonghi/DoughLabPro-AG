    "description": "Barbari is a thick, elongated Iranian flatbread characterized by its golden-brown crust, sesame seeds, and deep longitudinal grooves. Its defining feature is the 'Roomal' (or 'Sir') glaze—a paste of flour, water, and baking soda/sugar—brushed on before baking to create a crispy skin and promote browning.",
    "history": "Named after the 'Barbar' people (Hazaras) of Khorasan who brought the bread to Tehran during the Qajar era. It quickly became the most popular breakfast bread in Iran. Traditionally baked in Tanour ovens, it is known for its distinct shape and chewiness. The use of baking soda in the glaze (not the dough) is a unique chemical browning agent used for centuries.",
