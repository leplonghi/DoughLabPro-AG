    "description": "Traditional Neapolitan pizza as defined by the AVPN regulations: a minimally enriched, highly extensible dough with relatively low hydration by modern standards, fermented at room temperature and baked at extreme heat. It produces a soft, foldable center with a pronounced cornicione, light fermentation acidity and characteristic leopard spotting on the crust.",
    "history": "Flatbreads topped with ingredients existed for centuries around the Mediterranean, but the modern Neapolitan pizza emerged in Naples between the late 1700s and the 1800s, when tomatoes became widely accepted as food and soft-wheat flours milled to tipo 00 enabled very thin yet extensible doughs. In 1984, Antonio Pace and Lello Surace, together with leading Neapolitan pizzaioli, formalized the fundamental rules for the \"Verace Pizza Napoletana\" and founded the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (AVPN). Their disciplinare specifies ingredients, mixing, fermentation, shaping and baking requirements, protecting the style as a cultural and gastronomic reference.",

    "history": "New York style emerged when Italian immigrants adapted Neapolitan pizza to American wheat flours and gas-fired deck ovens in the early 1900s. American bread flour, with higher protein and different milling characteristics than Italian tipo 00, produced a chewier structure. Longer bake times at lower temperatures than Neapolitan required changes to hydration, oil and sugar. Over decades, the iconic large slices sold by the slice, the hand-tossed shaping and the foldable geometry became a distinct identity, separate from its Neapolitan roots.",
