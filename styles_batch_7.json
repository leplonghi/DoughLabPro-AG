    "description": "Pain de Campagne, or 'Country Bread', is the quintessential French rustic loaf. Historically, it was a large sourdough loaf made with high-extraction wheat flour and a small percentage of rye, designed to stay fresh for several days. It features a thick, dark crust and a chewy, flavorful crumb with mild acidity.",
    "history": "For centuries, communal ovens in French villages baked large sourdough loaves (MICHE) to feed families for a week. As white bread (baguettes) became fashionable in cities, country bread declined. It was revived in the late 20th century by artisanal bakers like Lionel Poilâne and theorists like Raymond Calvel, who championed the flavor of natural leavening and stone-milled flours.",

    "description": "Rugbrød is a dense, dark, brick-like bread made primarily from rye flour and cracked rye kernels (berries), often enriched with seeds (sunflower, flax, pumpkin). It is fermented with sourdough to make the rye digestible and structure stable. It is the foundation of 'Smørrebrød' (open-faced sandwiches).",
    "history": "Rye grows well in the cold, wet Nordic climate where wheat struggles. Historically, it was the fuel of the working class. The sourdough acidification is technically necessary: rye has high amylase enzyme activity, and without acid to inhibit it, the bread would become a gummy mess ('starch attack'). Modern versions focus on whole grains and seeds for health.",
